# Senior Engineer

TuShare's goal is to make it easy for people to share the things they no longer need with people that do. To do this we're building a community with a focus on environmental sustainability through giving and gratitude.  We are Australia’s fastest-growing giving network at the heart of the sharing economy. 

We're looking for a Ruby developer to join our team. You'll work on the full stack of our Rails application. Our application is reasonably large and we care a lot about maintaining a high standard of code quality. We use Postgres (yes, constraints, views and foreign keys!!), Sidekiq and Object Oriented design. This is a fun application to work on with interesting goals. 

Our user base is growing quickly so scaling while continuing to improve functionality is going to be one of the main challenges for the development team in the near future. We need someone who can think strategically, creatively and pragmatically and is able to finish what you start.

We're a small team, working remotely, so you need to be able to manage your own time and be good at communicating over the Internet. We use a process that's on the flexible end of Agile. But, as we grow, how we do our work will need to adapt to growth. We want your input on that. So you should have ideas about how to better build software and be keen to share and champion them.

## Responsibilities:

The duties of the position are as follows:

 *	Contribute to the design of the company’s software products and associated business models.
 
 *	Design and build high quality, well tested code.
 
 *	Contribute to the maintenance of the company’s IT systems.

## Requirements:

 * We want to make software that makes the world a better place, so should you.

 * Able to deliver features from requirements into production. We're a small team so you'll have to be a bit of a jack of all trades and be happy to tweak some CSS margins, fix a caching bug and diagnose an email parsing error.

 * Built at least one mid-large Rails application. You should have opinions of what works, what doesn't and how you'd do things differently. Tell us a war story or two.

 * Excellent data modelling skills. You should be able to build clean Object Oriented designs that are testable, separate concerns and build abstractions. You should know how to use service and form objects and decorators and presenters to build a well structured application.

 * You should be able to design relational data models that use features of the database to ensure integrity and consistency.

 * Use Test Driven Development.

 * Have some experience or interest in a non-Ruby platform or language. You don't have to have built anything major in it, but you shouldn't baulk at using a different tool for the job.

 * Demonstrated high degree of judgement and ability to work in a team environment.
 
 * Strong interpersonal and communication skills.

 * Fluent English.
