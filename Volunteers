## Company Overview
TuShare.com is a website that lets us share the things we no longer need with our friends and neighbours. It saves money, reduces clutter and is good for the planet. We believe that people are naturally generous and love to help each other. And the easier it is to share, the more people will do it. That's why TuShare is a great solution that makes giving items away and finding those you need as safe and easy as possible.
