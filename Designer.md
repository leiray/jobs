# Designer Position Description

TuShare's goal is to make it easy for people to share the things they no longer need with people that do. To do this we're building  a community with a focus on environmental sustainability through giving and gratitude.

We're looking a front-end developer or designer to join the TuShare team. Ultimately we want you to own the look and feel of TuShare and help us solve some tricky UX problems. It will be your job make TuShare as easy and fun to use as possible. You'll be the advocate for the user; understanding what makes sense to them, how they use TuShare and ensuring they have the best possible experience.

We're a small team working remotely, so you need to be able to manage your own time and be good at communicating over the Internet. We use a process that's on the flexible end of Agile. But, as we grow, how we do our work will need to grow too. We want your input on that. So you should have ideas about how to better build software and be keen to share and champion them.

## Requirements:

 * A good eye, sense of taste and attention to detail.

 * Ability to distil complex workflow and data interactions down to something that is a joy to use.

 * Highly proficient in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Enjoys working with and improving large existing CSS codebases. Builds clean and maintainable css.

 * Know how to test designs. Whether it's A/B testing, focus groups or gathering usage analytics, you'll use these tools to help validate TuShare's UX. 

 * Experience and the patience for making web applications work across multiple browsers, platforms and devices. A big part of this role will be to improve our desktop UI across a range of browsers. We started building for the mobile web and we think TuShare works great on those platforms, now we want the desktop experience to be just as good.  

 * Experience with Ruby on Rails and the development workflow that goes with a Rails app is a plus. We'll help you find your way around the app, but the less unfamiliar territory the better.

 * Demonstrated high degree of judgement and ability to work in a team environment.

 * A great communicator.
